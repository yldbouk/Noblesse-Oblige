PIXEL HORSE ANIMATIONS (VERSION 1.0)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello!

This notepad provides the steps to making your own Horse Rider animations with the PNG files.

This pack was made using Aseprite and only Patrons are granted access to the aseprite file. If you do not own this software and or are not a Patron then you are still on luck. I have exported every layer in order for you to be able to make your own regardless of the software or whether you are a Patron or not.

If you are a Patreon I have also separated the Leash, Saddle, Rider Equips (shirt, pants and armor) and the Horses (black, brown and white) and the Horse's armor (copper, iron, silver, steel, gold, cobalt, platinum, adamanting, crimson and angelic) in case you only want complete freedom to customize the rider.

If you are not a patron, you have the Leash, the Rider, and the horse separated.
